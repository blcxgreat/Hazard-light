Thelanding lights at Sea-Tac are busted, so we have to come up with a new set. In order to show pilots the wind direction across the runways we will build special wind indicators to put at the ends of all runways at Sea-Tac.Your circuit will be given two inputs (SW[0] and SW[1]), which indicates wind direction, and three lights to display the corresponding sequence of lights.
